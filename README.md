# RAG-Model-for-QA-Bot

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by combining retrieval-based and generative techniques for answering complex questions.

## Overview
In this approach, we use two key components:
1. **Document Retrieval**: The model retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base (like a vector database) based on the input query.
2. **Generative Response**: The retrieved documents are used as context, allowing the language model to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Steps

### 1. Data Embedding
We start by embedding documents and storing them in a vector database. In this example, we use Pinecone to store document embeddings and the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for creating document vectors. These embeddings enable efficient and accurate retrieval.

### 2. Query Embedding
When a user asks a question, it is embedded into a vector that represents the query. The model converts the input query into an embedding vector, which is used for document retrieval.

### 3. Document Retrieval
Using the query embedding, the model retrieves the top-k most relevant documents from the vector database. This retrieval process leverages similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to find documents that are semantically aligned with the input question.

### 4. Answer Generation
Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the model combines the content of these documents into a single context string. This context is then passed to a language model (e.g., Cohere or OpenAI GPT) to generate an answer.

### Code Flow
Here’s a high-level flow of the code:
- **Step 1**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Step 2**: Embed documents using a sentence transformer model.
- **Step 3**: Store document embeddings in Pinecone.
- **Step 4**: Embed the user query.
- **Step 5**: Retrieve relevant documents using Pinecone.
- **Step 6**: Generate a response using a language model (like Cohere).

## Why RAG?
- **Improved Accuracy**: RAG improves the accuracy of the answers by augmenting the model’s generation with relevant documents.
- **External Knowledge**: It integrates external knowledge into the model’s responses, which is crucial for up-to-date or domain-specific tasks.
- **Efficiency**: The retrieval mechanism ensures that the model focuses only on relevant information, leading to better, more relevant answers.

## Example Query
Here’s a practical example to illustrate how RAG works:

- **Query**: "What amount did NVIDIA record as an acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023?"
- **Retrieved Context**: Relevant financial documents from the knowledge base.
- **Generated Answer**: The model produces a precise, context-driven response based on the retrieved documents.

## Conclusion
Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines the strengths of retrieval and generation techniques to produce accurate and informed answers. This hybrid model is especially effective for tasks requiring external knowledge or up-to-date information, making it a powerful tool for QA bots and more.
